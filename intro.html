        <!-- write about hwo i found out about STEM and why i chose it -->
          <p>I found out about STEM from my teacher during sixth grade. When I first started learning about STEM, I was very interested in it. I was always curious about how things worked and how they could be used in our daily lives. When i graduated to high school, I joined my school Makers club which is focused on STEM.  </p>
